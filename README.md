- Responsive web interface
- Web based epub reader([satorumurmur/bibi](https://github.com/satorumurmur/bibi))


## Usage
Download the binary file from [release page](https://github.com/kyicy/readimension/releases)

or 
`go get -v github.com/kyicy/readimension`

Switch to an ***working directory*** where `readimension` will save data.

Create a configuration file, `config.json`
``` json
{
    "production": {
        "addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": "10086",
        "serve_static": false,
        "session_secret": "session_secret",
        "emails": ["example@example.com"],
        "google_analytics": "UA-****-*"
    },
    "development": {
        "addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": "10086",
        "serve_static": true,
        "session_secret": "session_secret",
        "emails": ["example@example.com"],
        "google_analytics": "UA-****-*"
    }
}
```
Then start the server
``` sh
readimension --env development --path .
```

`addr` and `port` defines which `ip` and `port` the web service shall listen to.
`emails` contains an array of emails are allowed to register users.

`readimension` will generate three folders {`uploads`, `covers`, `books`} and one database file `readimension.db`.

In production environment, it's preferred to set `serve_static` to false and set up a `nginx` instance to serve static files (`covers` and `books`).

Then, just enjoy reading.
